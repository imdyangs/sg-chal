This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

# Frontend Jobs Challenge
Create a React app that uses a public graphql API. The API is on top of a database that has information about Jobs (i.e. Software Engineer at Google, etc.) The playground and schema are available [here](https://api.graphql.jobs/).

User scenario
As a user, I would like to see a list of recent Job openings. I would also like to be able to see Jobs by city as I'm considering relocating. In addition to seeing an overall list view of open jobs, I'd like to be able to click through and view more details about a specific job.

Implementation
This challenge doesn't have many requirements on purpose. We'd like to see how you handle ambiguity. Keep the design clean and simple. Functionality is the biggest thing we'll look at. Code quality, style, and design are all secondary.

Let me know if you have any questions!
